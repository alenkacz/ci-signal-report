# CI signal report

You can get the current overview for CI signal report by running

```bash
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=xxx go run ./cmd/ci-reporter.go
```

It needs a GitHub token to be able to query the project board for CI signal. For some reason even though those boards are available for public view, the APIs require auth. See [this documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) to set up your access token.

## Prerequisites

- GoLang >=1.16

## Run the report

```bash
git clone git@github.com/alenkacz/ci-signal-report.git <folder>
cd <folder>
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=xxx go run main.go
```

### Flags

- `-h` info about the flags
- `-short` shortens the report output (This reduces the report to `New/Not Yet Started` and `In Flight` issues on github.)
- `-emoji-off` report does not print emojis (see example output with emojis)
- `-v XXX` specify a k8s release version that should be added to the testgrid report. Where the XXX can be like `1.22`, the report statistics get extended for the chosen version. To specify multiple version use `-v "1.22, 1.21"`
- `-json` prints in json format

Example

```bash
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=xxx go run ./cmd/ci-reporter.go -short
```

## Rate limits

GitHub API has rate limits, to see how much you have used you can query like this (replace User with your GH user and Token with your Auth Token):

```bash
curl \
  -u GIT_HUB-USER:GIT_HUB_TOKEN -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/rate_limit & curl \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/rate_limit
```

## Example output

```bash
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=XXX go run ./cmd/ci-reporter.go -short
